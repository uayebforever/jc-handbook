Sea Boat
========

The Sea Boat is a semi rigid inflatable boat manned by a Coxswain and
one Crew. The Coxswain is in command of the Sea Boat and with Crew
member must be conversant with the contents of this Module and Module 12
for Small Boat Handling - Sea Boat.

Launch and recovery is carried out by a team consisting of a crew of 8.
Each team member’s duties are listed on their crew card. The remainder
of the ship’s crew act as ordered. They may be also required to assist
in recovery.

Preparation and operation of the Sea Boat – refer Module 12. For the position
of Boat Rope, Painter and Painter Pendent refer to separate diagrams on pages
8, 9 and 10.

NOTE. (Also refer attached diagram.)

***Painter*** ( This is the main line used to tow the Sea Boat when it
is working alongside the ship)leads forward and is secured to a metal
pin forward of the foremast shrouds.

The painter has two positions marked:

1. Long mark (Ladder mark – long canvas strip on the painter), when used
   this will position the sea boat under the boarding ladder.

   It also allows the sea boat to be hoisted and stowed in its cradle.

2. Short mark (Davit mark – short canvas strip on the painter), this
   will position the sea boat under the davit fall.

For launch, the painter must be on the long mark and moved to the short
mark as soon as the boat is swung out. The reverse applies when
recovering the sea boat.

The marks on the painter are set at the pin.

    On the aft end of the painter is a steel ring into which the Sea
    Boat’s painter is clipped.

    ***Painter pendent*** is spliced into the painter. The painter
    pendent is controlled from a position forward of the main shrouds.
    This line is used to control the movement of the sea boat when it is
    being launched, alongside the ship and being recovered.

The bow of the sea boat is controlled at all times by the painter
pendent either from the deck or on the rail. A chafe patch on the
shroud/sheer pole can be used to take strain.

    ***Bowsing lines.*** To control the stern of the sea boat during
    launch and recovery two bowsing lines are used. One leads aft and
    the other forward. They are spliced together at a hook that in turn
    is attached by Snap Hook to the stern sling ring on the starboard
    side of the sea boat transom.

**Aft Bowsing** line is coiled and stowed on the aft side of the boat
skid.

**Fore Bowsing** line is coiled and stowed on the ladder leading to the
boat skids.

    Both lines are worked together to control the stern of the Sea Boat,
    refer to the next section.



Launch And Recovery Of The Sea Boat
===================================

Launch/Recovery Team and Duties
-------------------------------

Refer to next section for associated orders & action.

**Launch:**

#. Officer/Watchleader.
    * Control of the launch and recovery operations.
    * Ensure all crew are at their stations before commencing launch.
    * Release Pelican clips that retain gripes.
    * Attach Sea Boat painter, using the snap shackle, to the painter
      ring. (Ensure line is outboard of course sheets).
    * Release bowsing lines from the Sea Boat, after crew are aboard.
    * Attach the bowsing lines to the Sea Boat on recovery (before crew
      disembark.
    * Supervise lowering and recovery.
#. Davit After Guy Hand.
    * Use guy to control the movement of the davit.
    * Guy has a set mark to maximum travel for launch. Approx 45 degrees.
    * Control rate of swing particularly when the ship is rolling in a
      seaway.
    * When Davit is in position and Guy secure, assist on the fall.
    * Use guy to swing davit inboard during boat recovery.
    * Tension and secure on completion of operation.
#. Aft Bowsing Line Hand. (Wear climbing harness)
    * Attach climbing harness to strong point if it becomes necessary to
      go up to the Sea Boat platform.
    * Clear gripes from sea boat.
    * Return to the deck and lead the aft bowsing line outboard of the aft
      davit onto the quarter deck to control the stern of the sea boat. It may
      be necessary to take a turn around the davit.
    * Use bowsing line to swing boat and control its movement outboard
      when launching.
    * Be alert for excessive swing if the ship is rolling and keep the
      line taut.
    * When recovering the sea boat take the bowsing line off the davit and
      lead inboard to control the sea boat swing during recovery. Work with
      the forward bowsing line hand to control and position the sea boat over
      its cradle.
    * Pass gripes over the sea boat to secure it in the cradle.
#. Forward Bowsing Line Hand. Refer to Davit Fall Team.
    * During launch make sure the forward bowsing line is clear to run.
    * During recovery, work with the Aft Bowsing Line hand to swing the sea
      boat around and guide it over the cradle by hauling forward.
#. Painter Pendent Hand. (Wear climbing harness)
    * Painter Pendent is spliced to the Painter and used to control Painter
      end, during the launch and recovery to control the sea boat’s swing.
    * On launch keep tension on painter pennant to assist swing-out of davit.
    * Ease as boat is lowered and prevent bow dropping.
    * Have painter ready for return of the sea boat and once attached
      control position of the sea boat while it is alongside the ship.
#. Davit Fore Guy and Painter Hand.
    * Davit Fore Guy.
        * Haul davit outboard on launch (amount of travel is controlled by aft
          guy). Make fast and proceed to adjust painter.
        * When boat is being recovered adjust painter, return to fore davit
          guy and ease to allow davit to swing inboard.
    * Painter. (Also refer to notes following for layout diagram)

        * This line leads from forward of the fore mast shroud and has Painter
          Pennant spliced into it.

        * Painter has two fixed positions.

            1. Maximum length, long mark (Ladder mark) for swing out and in, and, if
               required, to allow emergency boat to fall back to boarding ladder.

            2. Shorten to short mark (Davit mark) for fixing the position of the
               boat under the davit, when it is being lowered into the water and
               recovered.

7.& 8. Davit Fall Team.

    Made up of two hands during lowering and recovery. Other spare hands
    can assist with recovery.

Launch - General Steps
----------------------

#. Secure the freeing port.

#. One hand gathers in main course sheet and secures to davit cleat
    using strop.

    Alternatively --- Depending on the ship’s course and the position of the main sail and
    yard it may be necessary to use the block and line seized to the
    port mizzen topmast guy to brail up the main sail port sheet and
    yard brace clear of the davit.

#. Second hand takes fall from pin and leads it down the deck.

#. Two hands heave boat from cradle and take a turn around the pin.

#. Once outboard, the boat is lowered to top rail.

#. When crew are on board, the boat is lowered to the water with plenty
    of slack in the fall. This will prevent the boat from being
    “plucked” unexpectedly from the water as the ship rolls and help
    crew to cast off the fall from the boat sling.

#. After boat is away haul in the fall and secure to topgallant rail.

#. When the boat is successfully launched assist rigging the boarding ladder.

Recovery - General steps
------------------------

#. When the sea boat returns the painter pendent hand lowers the
    painter ring to the sea boat. They connect using the snap hook.

#. When boat is in position under the davit lower fall. The crew attach
    it to the boat sling.

#. With fall off the pin, call crew to assist haul in fall to bring boat to
    the topgallant rail.

#. At the topgallant rail attach the bowsing lines.

#. After crew have disembarked, painter on the long or ladder mark,
    haul the sea boat to the cradle height. Pass fall around the pin.

Aft Bowsing line hand moves inboard and works with the Fore Bowsing
line hand to control the swing of the sea boat and guide it over the
cradle.

#. With davit inboard, lower the boat to rest in the cradle. Guide by
    using the sea boat’s painter and the forward bowsing line.

#. Secure gripes.

#. Lookout leaves the mizzen shrouds when all is secure.

#. Coil and stow fall.

#. Recover and stow boarding ladder.

#. Check that sea boat is ready for next launch.

Launching the seaboat in a seaway
=================================

Crew need to have a perspective on some of factors to be considered by
the Master before committing to launch the sea boat, thus gain an
understand of what could be a complex operation.

First Mate and Watchleader must be fully briefed on action to be taken.

In sheltered waters the following also applies however more so in the
open sea.

#. Course being steered;

    * Is the ship running free, on a broad reach, close reach, beam
      reach, close hauled?
    * Starboard tack or port tack?

#. Sea state – swell direction and size.
#. Strength of the wind and trend.
#. Launch on the lee side or weather side.
#. Sails set and action;

    * Rapid sail reduction
    * Reduce sails
    * Box yards to heave to.
    * Reduce sails and heave to
    * Rapid sail reduction and go to power

#. Position of rigging that may affect smooth launch. i.e. braces and
   sheets of the mainsail.
#. Recover under power only
#. Time of the day/night
#. Experience of the boat crew and launch crew.

The Master is faced with many decisions prior to committing the sea boat
and at worst in a MOB situation from having one crew in the water to
placing a further two in jeopardy.

Each of the points above have sub considerations with decisions to be
made. Some are those following. Can you think of others and more
importantly solutions.

#. Course being steered:

    #. To launch on the weather side exposes the sea boat to the direct
        force of the weather and sea. It will be driven against the ship’s
        hull.
    #. To launch on the lee side offers protection of the ship to the sea
        boat during launch and later recovery.
    #. If the ship is on a Starboard tack the sea boat will be in a lee

#. Sea state:

    #. Size and frequency of the swell.
    #. Wave height.

    Special care will be required by the launch and recovery team to
    compensate for these factors. Sea Boat Coxswain will have to be
    particularly careful when slipping from and reattaching the fall.

#. Strength of the wind and trend.

    #. Has it been building in strength
    #. Is it dropping off?

#. To launch on the weather or lee side.

    #. If the ship is on a starboard tack it may be safe to launch as the
       sea boat is on the lee side as the ships hull provides some
       protection. 
    #. If on a port tack the launch is exposed to the weather so it may
       be wise to defer the launch until the ship has come about.
       Critical recovery time will be lost.

#. Sail set and action.

    #. Stop the ship by boxing the yards?

        Starboard tack – box the main yards. This will require port mainsail
        braces and sheets to be brailed up clear of the davit.

        Port tack – box by bracing the main yards. Again main sail braces
        and sheets will need to be cleared.

        Raise tack and sheets on the mainsail will reduce the problem.

    #. Reduce sails to trim for boxing or heaving too.
    #. Rapid sail reduction to take in all sails and proceed under power.
    #. The taking in of all sails in a seaway will remove their stabilising
       effect and the ship will roll more thus further complicating the sea
       boat launch.

#. Position of rigging that may affect smooth launch. i.e. braces and
   sheets of the mainsail.

    Special block and lanyard has been mounted on the port mizzen stay
    to brail up main sail’s port brace.

#. Recovery under power.

    #. Once all sails are secure proceed with Williamson turn or enter
        search patters.
    #. Manoeuvre to safer position to launch the sea boat.

#. Time of the day/night and visibility. Is there sufficient daylight to
   complete the operation?
#. Experience of the boat crew and the suitability of the sea boat to
       handle the prevailing conditions.

For additional factors to be taken into account by the Sea Boat Coxswain
and crew when leaving and returning to the ship at sea when the ship is
moving under the influence of the prevailing wind, swell and general sea
state. Refer to Module 12.
