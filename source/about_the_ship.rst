About the James Craig
*********************

James Craig is a three masted Barque of approximately 1500 tonnes
displacement with an overall length of 70 metres.

The ship and others of the era were designed to carry cargo quickly and
safely around the world. They are principally ‘down wind’ ships with
limited ability to point high into the wind.
