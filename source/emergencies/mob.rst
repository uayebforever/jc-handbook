A Person Overboard
******************


Initial Response To Man Overboard (mob)
=======================================

Any member of the ship’s company, on seeing a person fall overboard,
calls out “Man Overboard” indicating side e.g. Port or Starboard, and
throws overboard any object that can float, life ring, life jacket etc.
Maintain visual contact and point at the person in the water until
relieved.

The Ship’s Master will decide to order the launch of the Sea Boat. Page
14 deals with some of the factors he will have to contend with.


Crew On Stern Lookout Watch (mob Watch)
=======================================


1.	On hearing the alarm or observing a person falling overboard, launch
the Dan Buoy, life ring and smoke/light marker.

2.	Point at the person in the water until relieved.

3.  When relieved, climb the Mizzen Shrouds and re-establish visual contact
with the person in the water and point.

4. Signal the direction to the person in the water to the sea boat crew.
Be aware that the Dan Buoy may not be near the person in the water.

5. Remain in the shrouds until the sea boat has returned and is safely
stowed on the ship or when relieved.
