**Overview:**

This is a very practical module and will require continual practical
application for proficiency to be developed.

**Assessment:**

Oral and practical examination by a Watchleader, who will, when
satisfied, sign off the tasks in crew members ‘Diary of Service and
Experience Log’ book.

Successful completion and submission of rope work exercise in Annexure
“A”.

**Outcome:**

A crew member will be able to identify lines, secure and handle lines
efficiently and safely.\ |image0|

DANGERS. DO NOT STAND IN BIGHTS, LOOPS ETC FOR THE REASONS SHOWN BELOW –

|image1|

**Do not stand on lines on the deck.** To do so leads to unnecessary
line ware and tangles and could result in you sustaining a twisted ankle
or being entangled in the lines.

SAFE LINE HANDLING

Injuries can easily happen while working lines. These include;

. Rope burn

. Being flicked in the face with rope ends

. Bruises

. Broken bones

. Crushed fingers and limbs.

. Trapped long hair and beards.

Key rules to avoid injury-

Be aware of others around you when handling lines

Good line preparation

Keeping the work area ordered

Staying clear of danger zones where lines lead -

Into sheaves.

Through fairleads

Onto pins and bitts

Where bights of lines lie along the deck.

Lines under or about to come under extreme load.

Check line tension before removing turns from pins or bitts to assess
potential load.

If not sure what is required, ask for further clarification of order.

Few lines can be worked by one person, seek assistance from other crew.

Grip a line with fingers, do not wrap thumb around a line.

    When a hand is near a pin, grip the line so that the little finger
    is closest to the pin.

    Always keep the hands a safe distance from the pin when hauling or
    easing a line.

    |image2|

    **DO NOT** allow a line to slip or run freely through your hands. To
    do so may result in loss of control and severe burns.

    When assisting to haul on a line, **do not let go** until the person
    controlling the line at the pin calls “Turns On”.The person
    controlling the line at the pin may use the following orders:

    -“Ease to the Pin” – Crew assisting will move the line slowly
    towards the pin.

-“Come up” – Crew assisting will let go the line.

-“Take the load” – Crew nearby will take hold of the line ahead of the
pin to assist hold the load on the line until the line is belayed.

    **DO NOT stand on lines that are lying on the deck.**

**CAUTION NOTE,** The wearing of gloves is optional when handling lines.
Beware of overconfidence as the gloves may become entangled and draw
hands into pins etc.

**PALMING DOWN.**

|image3|

This is the safest way to reduce turns on a pin as it assists the
friction as you reduce the turns. It should become standard practice
whether there is weight on the line or not.

The order “Palm down to one turn” is given by the watchleader.

1. Once the coil has been removed from the pin and placed on the deck,
   take off the belaying hitch.

2. Place the bottom of one palm over the turns and keep the fingers
   stretched and clear of the line.

3. Slowly take the turns off the pin with the other hand and immediately
   replace the palm on the remaining turns to maintain the friction.

4. Depending on the wind strength and tension on the line beware that
   the line may start to slip as you reduce the turns. If this starts to
   occur, do not remove any more turns and lay back on the free end.
   Inform your watch leader and call for back-up.

5. In normal circumstances you should be able to reduce to one turn and
   then lay back on the free end and await further orders.

6. When there is weight on the line, you should be able to safely serge
   the line with one turn around the pin by easing the weight you are
   holding but be ready to slam the palm back on the turn as you replace
   turns on the pin.

When placing turns on a pin after hoisting a sail or hauling in a sheet,
palming can assist the friction on the pin as you turn up.

Experience has shown that the left palm is preferred if you are
right-handed and so on.

**BELAYING LINES TO A PIN**

After an order to stop hauling – “Well” (well enough) or “Avast Hauling”
(stop

hauling) the next order given to secure the line to a belaying pin,
spider band pin or post etc. will be: “belay” or "make fast".

**To belay to a pin in the main rail or fife rails**

Lines from **ABOVE** – e.g. Clew lines, bunt lines, etc.

    \* If the line leads vertically down to its pin, then take it to the
    left side. Diagram (a)

    \* If the line leads down at an angle to the pin, take it to that
    side from which it approaches. Diagram (b) and (c)

Note the strategy: that, so far as possible, all turns on pins is taken
from left to right.

    \* Make a full turn on the boss, then commence figure 8 turns left
    to right around the pin.

Complete three full figure 8 turns.

|image6|

A line from above. A line from below.

Note that spider band belays provide considerably less friction grip
than belays to pins on the rails.

Take appropriate care with lines under heavy load.

As each turn is made around the upper part of a pin, give it a tug with
your body weight to remove all slack.

**Method of securing a belayed line to a pin (Belaying Hitch)**

This prevents the line from being accidentally released if a coil is
knocked or washed off the pin.

|image7|

1. Begin the belay in the usual way with regard to the lead of the line
to the pin or cleat.

2. Lay on at least two full figure-of-eight turns clockwise around the
top of the pin. On the third or subsequent last turn, half hitch to
secure the belay.

3. There are just two ways of forming the half hitch. The right way –
where two parts of the line will lay neatly side-by-side with one part
across them, refer to above photograph, and the wrong way, which will
appear as a messy jumble.

4. This belay is seamanlike, will not jam, is neat and, most
importantly, SECURE. It will not wash off the pin (big seas) or
accidentally get knocked off and let go.

5. It should be used on all lines under tension; that is, all halyards,
sheets, braces, etc. If in doubt, use it.

|image8|

**A – Left lead. B – Right Lead C – Completing a belaying hitch**

**COILING LINES**

Due to the size and length of the ship’s lines, making up the coils is
best performed on the deck.

1. Stand astride the line, across the deck. Lean over the centre of the
   coil and feed the line down and around the coil.

2. Start coiling from the standing end.

3. Coil in a clockwise direction.

4. Make coils 4 deck boards in diameter.

5. Remove any twists by rolling the line with the fingers.

6. Take care; remember that a messy coil may foul when placed on the
   deck to run.

7. If line has developed a bad twist, run it down the deck to work out
   the twist as it is coiled.

8. Pick up the completed coil and hold so the line from the pin leads to
   the face of the coil. Take the first loop from the face of the coil
   and place it over the pin (Diagram A). This provides a loop to pull
   through the centre of the coil pass over the top and over the pin to
   secure the coil to the pin and rail (Diagram B).

..

    |image9| |image10|

    Diagram A Diagram B

9.  When the coil has been secured on a pin, the bottom of the coil
    should be 4” (10cm) clear of the deck.

10. When the coil is finished the line’s end whippings should be visible
    inboard.

**BELAYING PIN DIAGRAMS.**

|image11|

|image12|

|image13|

**STOPPERS AND STOPPERING**

To belay a rope which is under strain, the strain must be taken
temporarily with a stopper.

The type of stopper used depends on whether it is to hold a fibre or
wire rope, chain/cable and on the strain it is required to take.

In these notes we refer to rope to rope stoppers. For the other types
and methods refer to Module 16.17.

Stopper, is the name given to a short length of line secured at one end
to a belaying pin, stanchion etc to hold temporarily (“stop”) parts of
the running rigging, a larger line or cable. The rolling hitch below is
ideal to secure the running end to the line being stopped.

A stopper may also be passed to secured “married” lines while the
running end is being belayed.

Uses in the James Craig include;

-  Holding the upper topsail halyard while it is being belayed.

-  Securing the anchor hauling out line in association with the
   windlass.

-  Setting up braces for tacking using by the wind hitches.

-  Situation requiring the transfer of lines under load to from bits or
   pins to other points.

There are many types of stopper and stoppering arrangements.

In the James Craig the following stopping lines are fitted -

\* There are fixed stopper lines attached to the Upper topsail halyard
blocks.

\* A stopper line is part of the windlass kit for hauling out the
stockless anchor.

\* Portable stopper lines are stowed on the forward shroud of each mast
(port and starboard).

The portable stopper lines are 3 meter lengths of 12mm roblin line with
an eye in one end, to assist secure to a pin or other strong point. The
other end is used to make the following rolling hitch around the line to
be held.

A rolling hitch shown is to be used to secure the stopper line or handy
billy tail (refer later) to the line to be stopped or hauled.

Similar to a clove hitch however the second and third turns override the
first turn. A half hitch is to be used to secure the running end.

**DO NOT HOLD THE RUNNING END BY HAND.**

|image14|

|image15|

*A rolling hitch being passed on the running end of a stopper line to
hold a head sail sheet prior to working the pin. The eye of the stopper
line is on the botton of the pin behind the sheet being worked on.*

|image16|

*A fixed stopper is secured with a rolling hitch to hold the upper
topsail halyard until the running end is belayed to its pin.*

It is possible to hold the running end of the rolling hitch however in
the ship this must not be used.

Dangers of holding the tail by hand include;

= the load exceeding the holders ability to contain

= loss of grip should the ship roll and holder loose balance

= flogging sails leading to hand/wrist injury

= burn injury to the holder and the crew on the running end should the
stopper let go.

Benefits of this hitch include;

+ the rolling hitch can be formed without load then slid up the line to
take the load.

+ after hauling the hitch can be again slid up the line being hauled
ready for hauling again.

+ easy to tie and release after load.

**MARRYING LINES.**

This involves twisting together two or more lines in a fall or two
sheets, so that the friction created between the bundled lines stops the
lines moving while the running end is being belayed.

Although, again, this can be hand held under light loads, a stopper
should be passed if high load is estimated or in any doubt in ability to
contain.

|image17|

|image18|\ *The Main Lower Topsail sheets, in turn, are gathered
together* **left**\ *, twisted to create friction between the parts thus
assisting hold the load* **right** *until the sheet is belayed to the
pin on the spider band.*

**HANDY BILLY.**

When using a handy billy to assist hauling on a line such as a head sail
or staysail sheet the rolling hitch shown above should be used to attach
the tail of the handy billy to the loaded line.

Examples;

-  Hauling out the spanker outhaul when setting the sail.

-  Securing the handy billy to lines when additional hauling power is
   required.

..

    - The tail rope on a handybilly is secured using the rolling hitch.

Also refer to the Purchases and Tackles Module 16.4.

|image19|

*Handy billy rigged to assist set the main sail tack - Note it is rigged
to disadvantage.*

*When rigged, this set up enables crew to haul down the main sail
weather clew when setting and trimming the sail.*

|image20|

*Handy billy rigged to assist haul in a stern line.*

**SAFETY NOTE**

**When working a hawser on bitts, machinery such as the Capstan or
Windlass, where possible, DO NOT wear a climbing harness to avoid
accidental entanglement of the harness and or its lanyards.**

**When surging or snubbing a synthetic fibre line around bitts, post or
warping drum us extreme care and backup. Synthetic line tends to heat up
and melt under loanand friction thus causing it to lose its grip.**

**BELAYING TO STAG HORN BITTS**

A versatile bitt that can be used to work and secure a line from any
direction.

**The Tugboat, Lighterman’s Hitch.**

The hitch is a means of belaying the end of a line (Tack, Berthing Line
etc) to a bollard, post, bit or capstan so that it can be left
unattended. It can be used in any situation where it can be easily and
quickly cast off without danger of being foul of the Post etc.

|image28|\ For example the Fore Course (Foresail) Tack to the Capstan.

Tack leads to the capstan and three turns are passed clockwise.

|image29|

Form a loop under the standing part.

The loop is then picked up from under the standing part and passed over
the capstan.

Make sure the segment of the line being passed around the capstan lies
close on top of the turns already around the capstan.

|image30|

Another loop of line is then picked up from under the standing part and
brought back around the capstan in the opposite direction.

Make sure the segment of the line being passed around the capstan lies
close on top of the turns already around the capstan

|image31|\ The final turn around the capstan is tightened down and
draped over as shown.

If the line starts to slip, the series of bights will tighten down and
pull on the standing part of the line in the opposite direction. Also,
since the topmost three turns around the capstan run in opposite
directions, they would rub against each other, thus providing additional
security against slippage

The tugboat hitch can be easily cast off under control.

|image32|

**LAYOUT OF FORE DECK WITH CAPSTAN AND WINDLASS.** Also refer Module 13
– Anchors

|image33|

**WORKING WITH THE CAPSTAN**

Also refer to Module 16.2 for operation details.

|image34|

**NOTE;** Always maintain a firm grip on the tailing line, at ALL times.
**DO NOT ALLOW THE LINE TO RUN FREELY THROUGH YOUR HANDS.**

Surge or take in the line hand over hand and have the line backed up in
need.

**Make the running end of any line being worked on the capstan fast by
passing figure of “8” turns around the bar passing through one of the
cat heads.** This make the line easy to control and keeps hands clear of
turns on the capstan.

**WORKING WITH THE WARPING DRUM**

Also refer to Module 16.1 for operation details.

|image35|

**NOTE;** Always maintain a firm grip on the tailing line at ALL times.
**DO NOT ALLOW THE LINE TO RUN FREELY THROUGH YOUR HANDS.** Veer or take
in line hand over hand.

To reduce the risk of the line accidentally running off the end of the
warping drum a flange has been welded to the outside end of the Port
warping drum only.

**BASIC KNOTS, BENDS & HITCHES**

“Knots” fall into three main categories – knots, bends and hitches, and
also in a sense whipping, seizing and lashing.

Knots - The rope is tied to itself.

Bends - Used to join the ends of two ropes together.

Hitches - Are used to tie a rope to something else e.g. a spar, another
rope, ring, post etc.

Whipping consists of binding a light line around the end of a rope to
prevent it from fraying.

Seizing consist of binding a light line around two ropes to join them or
to form a loop.

Lashings consist of using rope to join two or more spars.

Although these definitions are generally correct, the word “knot” is
also used in a generic sense. Sometimes the name in common use does not
follow the rules, the Fisherman’s Bend is really a hitch, as it is used
to tie a rope to a spar or ring, and the Fisherman’s Knot is a bend as
it is used to join two ropes.

The following are knots, bends, hitches, whippings etc used in the ship.

For additional rope work, refer to the Sydney Heritage Fleet Rope and
Rigging Handbook.

**BASIC KNOTS, BENDS & HITCHES**

|image36|

**Terms;**

***Overhand knot* –** To make a stop on a *Figure of eight* – as for an

rope, prevent end fraying, prevent line Overhand knot, but easier

slipping through a block. to untie.

|image37| |image38|

***Reef knot* –** Joining two ends – CAUTION can easily undo. Not
suitable for

Lines of different diameter.

|image39|

***Fisherman’s knot* –** Joining two ends.

|image40|

|image41|

***Round turn*** ***Clove hitch* –** Hitch the end of a line to a rail
or post etc. NOT SAFE

unless running end is secured with an additional half hitches.

|image42| |image43|

***olling hitch* –** To secure a stopper, or two ropes pulling in
opposite directions.

*imber hitch and half hitch* – **Securing a line to an object. Safe
while under constant load.**\ |image44|

***Timber hitch***\ |image45|

***Timber Hitch***

|image46|

*Sheet bend* – To join the ends of two lines of equal or different
diameters. Bend is secure while under constant load. If used where load
fluctuates, seize the running ends to respective standing parts.

|image47|

***Double sheet bend* –** More secure than single sheet bend, especially
if line diameters very considerably.

|image48|

*Double sheet bend on a hard eye* – With fluctuating loads, seize
running end.

|image49|

***Bollard hitch* / Tugman’s hitch /Lighterman’s hitch –** Excellent to
secure a line.

|image50|

***Awning hitch***

|image51|

***Bowline* –** Use to make a temporary eye in the end of a rope.

|image52|\ |image53|

***Secure a coil with a gasket hitch*** ***Line stowing hitch***

|image54| |image55| |image56|

***A round turn and two half hitches* -** Used to secure the running end
of a line. The more turns made before the hitches are made the more
control that is possible.

|image57|

***Buntline Hitch –*** To secure the end of a line to an eye, e.g.
securing the end of a buntline to the foot of a sail. Very secure.

|image58|

***A round turn and two half hitches using a bight -***

Use a bight to complete the round turns and two half hitches.

**Shown here are three way to secure a sail to a spar.**

***Marling hitching***

Used similar to half hitching however more secure. A series of overhand
knots.

|image60|

***Half hitching***

Method of lashing a number of objects together or a sail to a spar,
consisting of a series of half hitches.

|image61|

***Swedish furl***

A chain of loops. Easy to undo, simply release the end and pull. Uses
more line than

the other methods above.

|image62|

***Whipping is applied to the end of a line to prevent it from coming
apart.***

Common whipping – Good temporary whipping

|image63|

***Needle and palm whipping*** – Very secure whipping

|image64|

*Sail makers whipping*

|image65|

***West Country Whipping* –** This “whipping” is also used when binding
together the strands of a roband, when securing the head of a square
sail to its jackstay.

**COILING CLUES - THE 10 COMMANDMENTS FOR THE PERFECT COIL.**

1. The line’s lead.

**Thou shalt not lead the line across the face of a pin.**

*(To do so makes it difficult to lay on turns and secure the coil to the
pin)*

2. Turns on a pin.

**Thou shalt always pass the line clockwise around the TOP of a pin.**

*(Lines have a right hand lay therefore favour being laid in a clockwise
direction)*

3. Belay to a pin.

**Thou shalt lay, at least, two FULL turns around a pin and then apply a
belay hitch. Heave taut each turn BEFORE placing on the next turn.**

*(This will ensure the line is secure and will reduce the chances of
“creep” under load.)*

4. Start Coiling.

**Thou shalt always start coiling a line from the STANDING (fixed)
end.**

*(This enables any twists in the line to be progressivelyworked out
towards the free end as the line is coiled.)*

5. Coil construction.

**Thou shalt ALWAYS coil in a CLOCKWISE direction with the coil
approximately four deck boards in diameter (not oval of in determent
length).**

*( Lines are made with a right hand lay, therefore have a natural
tendency to go that way, why force them to do the opposite? Speed should
not take priority over neatness. A well made coil will always run
without tangling. If the line tries to do a figure 8, you're probably
coiling anti-clockwise".)*

6. Picking up the coil.

**Pick up the coil from the deck at a point on the coil so that the tail
will not drop out.**

*( If you pick up the coil at the wrong spot the end will drop out. If
it does redo the coil, DO NOT just tuck it in.)*

7. Coil addresses the pin.

**The coil should face the pin i.e. the line from the pin leads directly
to the face of the coil.**

*( By so doing the coil, when removed from the pin and placed on deck-
NOT DROPPED- will run freely from the face.)*

8. Coil securing loop.

**The loop should pass through the coil, over the pin and down the back
of the pin to the rail. NOT sit on top of the pin.**

*( Thus the coil will be secure.)*

9. Finished and secured coil.

**You should be able to see the line’s end whippings on the final turn
outside the coil. The coil should be at least 100mm clear of the deck.**

*(Visible whippings indicate a good coil and deck clearance will ensure
the will be no chafing of the line on the deck.)*

10. Taking down coils.

**When taking a coil off a pin thou shalt NOT DROP the coil. You will
place it on the deck with the lead from the coil on top, for easing, or
lead the line along the deck ready for hauling.**

*(Dropping coils or placing them upside down on the deck will lead to
tangles and delays in what may be an urgent response to an order and may
even put the ship and crew mates at risk.)*

**If you HAVE NOT achieved ALL 10 commandments take the coil down and re
do.**

**Smart Coils = Smart Ship**

**Above all be diligent about your task lest you risk incurring the
wrath of the Watch Leader or Coil Police.**
