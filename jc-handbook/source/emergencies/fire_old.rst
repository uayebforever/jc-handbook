Fire

**Aim:**

To ensure crew are aware of the dangers of fire in the ship and
facilities and equipment on board to fight a fire.

**Overview:**

This module does not cover all aspects of fire fighting. However it
deals with those aspects relevant to the ship.

The following points will be covered in association with practical
application:

-  Fire prevention.

-  Basic principle of fire.

-  Equipment in the ship.

-  Crew response to a fire emergency.

-  Basic fire fighting strategies.

-  Fire extinguishers.

-  Hose reels.

-  Fire patrol.

-  Guide for Fire Party leader.

-  Fire incident procedures.

-  Chart of Fire Extinguishers.

**Assessment:**

Oral and practical examination by Mate/ Watchleader, who will, when
satisfied, sign off the appropriate tasks in crew member’s ‘Diary of
Service and Experience Log’ book.

**Outcome:**

Crew to understand the dangers associated with a fire on board and
become competent in alarm procedures and handling fire fighting
equipment in the ship.

**FIRE PREVENTION**

It is the responsibility of all crew to practice fire prevention by
being vigilant to any situation that could lead to fire.

Action should be taken immediately to correct any hazardous situation.

Prevention is better than cure, so;

Smoking is only permissible near the foremast.

Keep the ship tidy by disposing of or stow rags and rubbish safely.

Report any damage to Fire Fighting equipment to the Officer of the
Watch.

**BASIC PRINCIPLES OF FIRE – In brief.**

Fire is a chemical reaction. The most common chemical reaction is the
one between oxygen in the air and flammable vapours released from the
fuel.

The components necessary for a fire to burn, or continue to burn, are
illustrated in the fire triangle below.

Combustion is a process of oxidation i.e. a combination of oxygen and a
substance.

Substances oxidise at different temperatures. When a substance is
oxidising at such a rate that heat and light are being released, it is
described as being ‘alight’ or ‘on fire’.

For a fire to be sustained a chain reaction between the fuel and oxygen
is promoted by the heat.

Fire, once started, can be transferred or travel by;

- Radiation

- Convection

- Conduction

Therefore to fight a fire in the ship appropriate methods and equipment
are used to break, at least, one leg of the triangle and reduce the
ability of the fire to spread.

Some examples that may be used:-

Oxygen - restrict flow of air to the fire by smothering i.e. fire
blanket, extinguisher, seal a compartment.

Heat - if safe to do so, cool with water.

Fuel - turn off or, if possible, remove the source.

Radiation - shield with water fog or non flammable screen.

Convection - ventilate the space to allow flammable gas to escape
safely.

Conduction - cool down surfaces.

| **“ Alarm ”** Raise alarm and follow the ship’s emergency procedure.                                   |
|                                                                                                        |

|                                                                                                        |
| “\ **Extinguish”** Attempt to extinguish the fire *only if you are trained and it is safe to do so.*   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+



The closing of special doors e.g. Engine room doors, in the event of
fire are set out in respect to each compartment.

**CREW RESPONSE TO FIRE EMERGENCY**



**BASIC FIRE FIGHTING STRATEGIES**

**First attack Strategy**



**Second attack Strategies.**





**FIRE INCIDENT PROCEDURES**

In the event of a fire, the following **immediate actions** are to be
carried out:

    **Person Discovering the Fire**

    If possible, attack the fire with an appropriate extinguisher

    Evacuate the compartment, shutting the door/hatch

    Raise the alarm.

    Report the fire to the OOW.

    **Officer of the Watch**

    Sound the General Alarm and broadcast:

    *Emergency Stations, Emergency Stations, Emergency Stations,*

    *Fire, Fire, Fire*

    *Fire in the ………*..

    *Shut down all ventilation*.’

    The OOW is to manoeuvre the ship as required to reduce the wind over
    the deck and/or the ship’s motion.
