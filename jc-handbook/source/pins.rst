Learning the Ropes
******************

Learning to handle lines safely is important to avoid any number of hand injuriesâ€”or worse. Lines must be constantly handled, so good practice should become habit. 

Regardless of the situation, a few points always apply to maximise safety:

* Always keep well clear of catch points, such as the line passsing around the pin
* Never stand in the bight of a line
* handle a line "hand-over-hand", never allow it to slide through your hands.


Belaying to a pin 
-----------------

The line should follow a fair lead onto the pin, which really means it should take the most direct line around the pin, and not trap later turns. Most lines take their first turn under the pin, but those that lead up from the deck take their first turn around the top. After the first turn, three full figures of eight are turned up on top, always passing left to right around both the bottom and top of the pin. *James Craig* takes the unusual approach of requiring a locking turn on all lines belayed to a pin.

When making a line fast, it is important to keep tension on the line so it does not slip. This is done by holding the tension either with the palm of the hand not holding the line, or with the hand holding the line. As turns are laid on, the tension alternates between the palm and the hand leading the line. Hands should not pass the front face of the rail, and especially should never be behind a pin. We like our sailors to keep their fingers attached!


Palming down
------------

When a line is to be worked, it is *palmed down*. The tension in a line should always be checked before working. If excessive tension is found, stop and ask for advice. Then, when ordered, the turns are taken off, with tension is passed back and forth between the palm and the hand holding the line. Usually, the last turn around the bottom (or top) of the pin is left as a friction point to control the line, but if there is no load it may be taken entirely off the pin, depending on how it is to be worked. 


Sweating and Hauling
--------------------

Hauling on a line is simply pulling on the line hand over hand. It could be a line leading down to the deck from above, or a line leading along the deck. Hand over hand ensures that the line is always under control, particularly if a whole team is hauling the line.

When a line leading down from above can no longer be pulled by hauling, it must be sweated. The line is passed under its pin, and one person *tails* the line by pulling line through the pin, but not allowing any to slip back. Another person *sweats* by taking the line at eye level in both hands, pushing the line away, throwing their weight back and pulling the line out, and then bending the knees to drop down and bring the line in towards the pin. Two people can sweat a line together if more effort is required.


Walking a line down the deck
----------------------------

Where a line needs to be taken in smoothly and continuously, it is walked down the deck. Crew line up along the line, and on command, walk down the deck holding the line in their hands. The crew member furthest from the pin acts as tail, taking the line in hand over hand. As the crew walking reach the tail, they peel off, and go back to the start of the line to continue pulling. 


Belaying to a spider band or cleat
----------------------------------

Lines belayed at the spider band around the base of a mast, or a cleat, ar handled similarly to those on the pin rail. After leading onto the pin, a complete turn is passed around the neck of the pin before applying the usual figures-of-eight, left to right around the pin or cleat as usual.
